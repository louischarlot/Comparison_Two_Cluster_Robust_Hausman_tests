# Tests To The Test: Comparing Two Cluster-Robust Hausman Tests Using Monte Carlo

Final project by Louis CHARLOT, Chlo√© MAS and Rachel PAYA for the class "Econometric Methods" 
(Paris School of Economics, professor P. Ketz).

The pdf version of the project is available in the main directory as "Econometric_Methods_Final_Project.pdf"

The R code is available in the "Code" directory.


This project uses a Monte Carlo experiment to compare two types of cluster-robust Hausman
test: one based on the auxiliary regression method following Wooldridge (2010) and the
other one relying on the pairs cluster bootstrap procedure for the variance detailed in Cameron
and Miller (2015).

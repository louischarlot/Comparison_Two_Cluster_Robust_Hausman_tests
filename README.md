This article uses a Monte Carlo experiment to compare two types of cluster-robust Hausman
test: one based on the auxiliary regression method following Woolridge (2010) and the
other relying on the pairs cluster bootstrap procedure for the variance detailed in Cameron
and Miller (2015). Our findings indicate that the first type of cluster-robust Hausman test
is better to avoid type II errors while the second is better to avoid type I errors. Since the
failure to correctly reject the null is the primary concern in the Hausman test, we conclude
that the first test should be preferred.

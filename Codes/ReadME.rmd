Monte_Carlo.R is the main code, which calls the two other codes (Code_method_1.R and Code_method_2.R).

- Code_method_1.R defines the function associated to the 1st method to calculate the Cluster-Robst Hausman test, proposed by Wooldridge (2010).

- Code_method_2.R defines the function associated to the 2nd method to calculate the Cluster-Robst Hausman test, proposed by Miller et Cameron (2015)

- Monte_Carlo.R carries out the Monte Carlo comparison of the 2 methods for 2 different DGPs.
